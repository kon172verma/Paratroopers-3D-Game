# Paratroopers-3D-Game
Implementing the classic 1980s paratroopers game in 3D using unity framework.

# About the Game 

The player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen. The turret can swivel to cover a large area of the screen, but cannot move from its base. 

Helicopters fly across the screen at varying heights, dropping paratroopers. The gun may fire shots that may destroy helicopters or shoot paratroopers. Paratroopers may be disintegrated by a direct hit, or their parachutes may be shot. Periodically, attacking helicopters may fly by and drop bombs; the jets and bombs may be shot as well.

The player earns points by shooting helicopters, paratroopers, jets, and bombs. Also the more the player move forward in the game the level of the game also increases. Along with the level, the frequency of paratroopers, frequency of attacking helicopters and speed of the game increases. Thus, making it harder at each level.

A soldier who has taken his position can be killed by either directly shooting a bullet or throwing a grenade onto him.

The game ends when the danger level reaches to 10. Danger level increases when a paratrooper takes his position and starts shooting at the turret or the player's turret gets hit by a bomb. 

# Aim : To earn as much points as possible.
